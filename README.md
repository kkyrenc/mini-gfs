# MiniGFS: A Python-based Distributed File System Inspired by GFS

[![CI](https://github.com/kkyrenc/simple-distributed-file-system/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kkyrenc/simple-distributed-file-system/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)


MiniGFS is a lightweight, Python-implemented distributed file system, designed with the core principles of Google File System (GFS) as its blueprint. This project aims to provide a simplified yet functional version of a distributed file system, enabling efficient data storage, retrieval, and management across a network of machines. Through the implementation of key features such as consistent hashing for load balancing, heartbeat monitoring for system health, and replication for fault tolerance, MiniGFS demonstrates the essential mechanisms that underpin scalable distributed systems.
